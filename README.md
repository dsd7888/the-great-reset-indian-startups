# The Great Reset: Indian Startup Funding Before and After COVID  

## Why This Project?  
My background is rooted in both **computer science and entrepreneurship**—two fields that naturally converge in the startup ecosystem. Having grown up around business and developed a strong interest in data-driven problem-solving, I wanted to analyze how the **Indian startup funding landscape** transformed during one of the most disruptive global events: the COVID-19 pandemic.  

This project combines **data engineering, visualization, and business insight** to tell a compelling story of resilience, structural shifts, and investor behavior in India’s innovation economy.

## Objective  
To uncover **structural shifts in the Indian startup funding ecosystem** by comparing the investment landscape before and after COVID-19. Specifically, the analysis investigates:  
1. How funding volumes and deal sizes changed.  
2. Which sectors thrived or declined.  
3. How startup hubs evolved geographically.  
4. Which investors shaped the ecosystem.  
5. How risk appetite shifted across funding stages.  
6. The pandemic’s direct time-series impact.

## Methodology  

### Phase 1: Data Preparation  
- **Acquisition & Cleaning**: Pre-COVID and Post-COVID datasets were loaded, cleaned, and standardized.  
- **Unification**: Merged into a single master DataFrame with consistent columns.  
- **Labeling**: Each record was tagged as *Pre-COVID* or *Post-COVID* using a March 1, 2020 cutoff.  

### Phase 2: Comparative Analysis  
- Funding volumes and deal counts.  
- Sectoral shifts in capital allocation.  
- Geographical concentration of hubs.  
- Investor activity and deal dominance.  
- Funding stage preferences.  
- Time-series trends and inflection points.  
- Sector-level average deal size analysis.
